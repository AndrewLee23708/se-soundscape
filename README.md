Project Proposal: Music(playlists) tied to location
Users can set pins on the map and tie music/music playlist to those pins such that when a user approaches those pins, that particular playlist/music plays. Think of it like a videogame, when you walk into different zones/areas, new music themes play.
Stakeholders: Spotify will buy us, very simple.
Actors: Anyone who listens to music, 
Mainstream audience: Spotify listeners
Niche market: Gamers
Goals/Functionalities:
Add audio impression into environments and help people discover new music tastes
