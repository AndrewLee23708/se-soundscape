Project Proposal: Music(playlists) tied to location
Users can set pins on the map and tie music/music playlist to those pins such that when a user approaches those pins, that particular playlist/music plays. Think of it like a videogame, when you walk into different zones/areas, new music themes play.
This will also act as a social media as users can share their map playlist to others.

Stakeholders: Spotify will buy us, very simple.

Actors: Anyone who listens to music, 

Mainstream audience: Spotify listeners

Niche market: Gamers

Goals/Functionalities:
Add audio impression into environments and help people discover new music tastes

Discuss your chosen process:
We have chosen to adopt an agile-methodology based on these criteria:
Size: Since we only have 4 members, a small team size will allow us to communicate more effectively between roles.
Criticality:  Implementation we should keep in mind: keeping people's locations encrypted, privacy of their playlist and pins, making sure users are aware glitches in audio doesn't cause harm
Dynamism:  In this project we want to be able to adapt to what our program needs so our project will probably be dynamic especially as Spotify's api might change.
Skill level: Since we all either have experience or interest in full stack development, we all have a good understanding of the processes involved in developing one, which will prove useful in the agile methodology.
Culture:  Our team's culture is deeply rooted in innovation, collaboration, and a shared passion for enhancing the music listening experience through technology. As all geeky gamers(only some who play league of legends), we want to see this project come to fruition as we all have shared interests in some way to this project. We all have ideas of where this project can go, thus it would be best to adopt an agile methodology to account for these.
